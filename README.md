This project some core statistical concepts such as:
•	mathematical data types
•	null and alternative hypothesis
•	p-values and hypothesis testing
•	t-test of the means
•	correlation and linear regression tests
•	comparing frequency distribution using chi-squared test

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

To predict mpg, this model uses five independent variables: vehicle_length, vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, ground_clearance and AWD. 
According to the results of the multiple linear regression, none of the independent variables are statistically significant to predict future mpg observations and measurements.

The p-values are: vehicle_length is 2.60e-12, vehicle_weight is 0.078, spoiler_angle is 0.31, ground_clearance is 21e-08, and for AWD is 0.19. The intercept (slope) is 5.08e-08.

write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
